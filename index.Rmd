## Lexicalization and Language Change

詞彙與詞彙化的變遷研究

> - Language in use is a dynamically developing system adapting to its ever-changing social environment.
> - Language change: phenomenon or epiphenomenon (of a static capacity, Lehmann 1993:320)?
> - Lexicalization: the process by which new items that are considered 'lexical' come into being (Brinton and Traugot, 2005)
  - __adoption into the lexicon__
  - __falling outside the productive rules of grammar__



---

## The Emergent Lexicon 

- Lexicon is understood as *a finite list of forms and the possibilities for combining them*

- Functionalistic take on the (Mental) Lexicon (,if any):
    - 'our understanding of both language structure and use is enhanced by the recognition that memory for language is highly affected by language use' (Bybee,1998).
    - The memory representation of language consists of units that can constitute utterances or intonation units, i.e., not just words, but also phrases and constructions. 

- It is the __formulation__ that annoies linguists.


---

## The Emergent Lexicon 

$$
\mathbf{Change}_{a,b} = \mathbf{A} \succ \mathbf{B}
$$

$$
\mathbf{Change}_{a,b} = \mathbf{A} \succ 
 \begin{Bmatrix}
  A \\
  B 
 \end{Bmatrix}
 \succ \mathbf{(B)}
$$

`Most attention were paid to the questions "What is in the arrow?" and "How does change come about?"`

## The Emergent Lexicon v.2 : Before and After

> - Lexicalization (and grammaticalization) 談的是如何進場 
> - 網路時代的海量數據引出了語言單位的**生命力**指標量度需求（能活多久或為何退場）? BUT note [pressing `p`]

In some cases words might be *dead* to all purposes, but could revived by the media periodically for the purpose of *irony* or *parody*.

## Questions to be answered 
  
**Big Three** (Brinton and Traugott, 2005)

1. The constraint problem: what is the set of possible changes and linguistic conditions for change?
2. The transition problem: what are the intresting stages that define the path by which A gives rise to B?
3. The actuation problem: how does change start, when and where does it start ('actuation') and how does it spread through the system ('actualization')?

## Neologism and Lexicalization
  
晚近的新詞研究

- Neologisms (new entries in the inventory) can be seen as the results of the *conception of lexicalization*.
- The production of neologisms encompasses a wide variety of linguistic processes, both sybchronic and diachronic.
- Mechanisms involved: *create, modify, combine,* or *separate* existing units, and thus lexicalization would seem to include opposing directions of change leading to greater or lesser **dependency** and greater or lesser **compositionality**.



--- bg:#F0FFF0
  
## Neologism Classification
  
1. [`Renouf's classification` 2013]: __lexical neology__ (i.e., newly-coined lexical items) and __semantic neology__ (i.e., new sense of word) and __grammatical neology__ (i.e., neologisms that change grammatical class). 
<!-- new connotative sense? 加倍奉還 -->

2. e.g, [Arab Spring](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Arab%20spring&cmpt=q); troll (an individual who posts inflammatory, rude, and obnoxious comments to an online community); [friend](http://www.wordnik.com/words/friend).

3. *lexical neology* and *semantic neology* can be identified in a text corpus at surface level by automatic means (by comparing existing lexicon and discovering the change in collocational environments), while *grammatical neology* can be identified at a post-processing stage of  semantic neology.


<!-- http://www.vappingo.com/word-blog/great-examples-of-neologisms/
Examples of Popular Culture Neologisms

Tebowing: description of a prayerful victory stance derived from NFL quarterback Tim Tebow.
Brangelina: used to refer to supercouple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
Metrosexual: A man who dedicates a great deal of time and money to his appearance.
Muffin top: This refers to the (often unsightly) roll of fat that appears on top of trousers that feature a low waist.
Stitch 'n' bitch: A gathering of individuals who chat or gossip while knitting or crocheting.
BFF: Stands for best friends forever. Used to state how close you are to another individual.
Vagjayjay: Slang term for the vagina that was believed to have been coined by Oprah.
Chilax: To calm down or relax, it is a slang term used when someone is starting to get uptight about something that is happening.
Racne: Acne located on a woman’s chest.
Staycation: A vacation at home or in the immediate local area.

## Neologism Detection in (Computational) Linguistics

*** {class: active, id: language resources}

You need **corpus and lexicon** are the prerequisite for an empirical surveys. A *reference* corpus will make the identification task simpler: An *unseen* word is matched against the corpus so that it is pinpointed at its first occurrence, and deemed to be a candidate for neologism. (cf. *hapax legomena*)

*** {id: algorithms}

<img src="assets/img/pipeline.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 450px;"/>

Use **collocational information** to (semi-) automatically determine the candidate's usage and definition.

## Google Books for [Culturomics](http://www.culturomics.org/)

- Google corpus of digitized texts containing about 6% (over 8
million books) of all books ever printed.

> Analysis of this corpus enables us to investigate cultural trends quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of 'culturomics,' focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as **lexicography**, the **evolution of grammar**, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology.(*Science, 331(6014): 176–82*, 2011).

## New Methodological Issues [1]: Size

Do we really need (more than) 500 billion words for linguistics?
- e.g., [COHA:THE CORPUS OF HISTORICAL AMERICAN ENGLISH](http://corpus.byu.edu/coha/) vs. [Google Book ngram] 

Are there any __hard rules__ regarding how large a corpus ought to be? 

> For the study of prosody (i.e. the rhythm, stress and intonation of speech), a corpus of 100,000 words will usually be big enough to make generalizations; for the analysis of verb-form morphology (i.e. the use of endings such as -ed, -ing and -s to express verb tenses) would require half a million words. (Kennedy (1998: 68)), while Biber (1993) suggests that a million words would be enough for grammatical studies.

## Modeling Neologistic Behavour [1]

詞彙的生命週期 Stage in Life-cycle (Renouf, 2013)
- Increase in frequency: gradual, or sudden if in vogue
- Orthographic adjustment
- Lexical productivity
- Creativity
- Settling down
- Obsolescence
- Death
- Re-birth or revival

## Modeling Lexical Aging: First try (Liu,Hsieh and Prevot, 2013)

- **Proper nouns** are ruled out, for they are mostly propelled into the media glare due to a real-world event ot popular preoccupation.
- PTT-based (2015-2012, 八卦版+就可版+笨版), preproceesed.

- These large, short-term fluctuations add an important new dimension to the study of the long-term dynamics of language, as any novel expression must survive in the short
term to survive in the long term. (Altmann, 2011)

## Modeling Lexical Aging: Our Second Comings 

不是二元的分類問題，應有新的訓練與評測方法

1. Use `google book ngram` as training data (to infer the laws), and `ptt` as test data.

2. In addition to previous efforts that exploit the syntagmatic patterns of a candidate neologism (e.g., via `collocate profile`), we also propose to incorporate paradigmatic patterns (via creating `social network` of the candidate).

4. Power the predition model with weights from human jugements (via questionnaire web application or APP games)


---

## Modeling Lexical Aging: Our Second Comings 

**Special considerations**

詞彙不像人，可以離群索居，成就自己的意義。詞彙的意義是透過系統間的關係相對定義出來的。
因此我們認為應該關注詞彙的社會行為。(以魯蛇為例)。


1. Frequency Diversity (e.g., the dissemination of words across individuals/generations/topics/boards/...)

2. Strength of Ties

3. Niche (when different forms compete to express the same meaning)

## Where do we go from here? 

- 大數據正在改變語言學 Big data help us understand the nature of linguistic and cultural dynamicality.
- 詞彙生命量度是個測試好例子 Measuring/modeling Lexical aging involves every aspects of lexicology.
- 大詞庫將是必備工具箱 We hope that this study could serve as an invitation to lexicologists in exploring their *lexical data* beyond micro-levels of analysis, and using big data as the 'toolkit' to map the contours of lexicology.

## Implications and Applications

- 模擬語言變遷的機會 Modeling lexical changes
- 重估新詞的地位 OOV reestimation in NLP
- 客觀化辭典收詞標準Measures are useful for **lexicographers, translators** and **terminologists**. 
    - [Traditional ways](http://www.merriam-webster.com/help/faq/words_in.htm) to decide which words to include in the dictionary and to determine what they mean could be improved/enhanced with computational linguistics.

In the days following Miley Cyrus’s much-discussed bump-and-grind performance at Sunday’s MTV Video Music Awards, the word “twerk” — that is, to dance “in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance” — seems to be ubiquitous. It’s on the tip of the tongue of nearly every television host, and a search of LexisNexis archives turns up the word in more than 250 news articles in the last week alone.
